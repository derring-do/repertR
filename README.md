  > The extended movie version of the DuckTales theme has a second verse, with blink-and-you’ll-miss-it fowl-themed wordplay (“Bold de-duck-tion never fails”). But in the version most often heard, the theme ascends a synthy scalar staircase to the mood-shifting bridge: “D-d-d-danger lurks behind you”—not just explicitly addressing the rapt viewer but, with the trembling lyric, signifying that even the singer is imperiled. (Thirty years after Pescetto laid down his version, this was Felicia Barton’s favorite bit to sing.)
  >
  > The bridge contains one of the more cunning key changes of the 80s, subliminally upping the ante for the final chorus. (Compare it to Bon Jovi’s “Livin’ on a Prayer,” recorded around the same time, whose key change catapults its vocalist into the stratosphere.)
  >
  > As if rallying for the euphoric victory lap, the horns thrash out a furious flurry of notes—technically demanding, especially for Reichenbach on trombone, and most audible in the instrumental end-credits theme. The lick recalls the brassy turbulence that announce the choruses of “Rosanna,” also arranged by Hey and performed by the trio. Finally, there are three more impassioned declarations of “DuckTales,” plus one instance of “. . . Bad and good luck tales!” and a delightfully daft clarification, which Pescetto manages to sell, as ever: “Not pony tails or cottontails.” There’s a battering of the toms, and it’s all capped off with one more mighty splash of brass—the perfect exclamation point.
